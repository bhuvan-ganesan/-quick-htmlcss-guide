# Introduction

In this HTMl & CSS tutorial, you will learn HTML, the standard markup language for the web. HTML is used to build the skeleton or outline of any website. The skeleton or outline of the website is styled(beautified) by CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). JavaScript (JS) can make a website interactive and dynamic. HTML, CSS and JS are the core technologies to build websites and these are the skills required to be a web developer. 

The main goal of this tutorial is to teach the core building block of the web that is HTML & CSS. Therefore, let's get started by understanding some the terminologies in this field such as web development, front end development, back end development, and full-stack

## Web Development

Web development is a process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining a website which ranges from a simple single page static website to a complex full-stack applications. This field has two broad categories.

- Frontend
- Backend

## Frontend Web Development

A frontend (client-side) is a website that a user can see and interact with. It can also be called a client-side because it is the part that the user (client) can see and interact with. Therefore, everything we see on a website when we browse the web is part of the frontend and includes the colors, fonts, buttons, images, videos, audios and all other content on the website. The technologies used to create the front-end parts of a website are called front-end technologies. The core technologies to build a front end are

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

There are hundreds of JavaScript libraries that can be used to create dynamic web applications. Currently, the three most popular JavaScript libraries are

- React
- Vue
- Angular

Do not learn JavaScript before HTML and CSS. Do not learn JavaScript libraries before you learn JavaScript. This is the correct order of learning 

**HTML > CSS > JavaScript > React or Vue or Angular.**

## Backend Web Development

Backend(server-side) development refers to the activities that take place behind the scene. Backend development consists of a backend, a programming language, and a database. The backend interacts with the frontend and database using a backend programming language (Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.). Take a look at the following figure to understand the interaction between clients. A client sends an HTTP request to the backend and the backend returns an HTTP response to the client computer (the response can be an HTML page, text, image, or some other form of data). HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol that allows data to be transferred between a client and a server. It is designed for communication between web browsers (client) and web servers.

## Full-stack Web Development

Full-stack is another buzzword where no one agrees on the definition. You can understand full-stack web development as a sum of frontend, backend, testing and some other technologies. 

I think you have an overall picture of web development now.
